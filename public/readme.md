This is a simple lightning wallet frontend derived from the Udemy Course taught by PlebDev: Building a Lightning App. 

my intention with this project was to learn frontend and how to interact with the lightning network. From here I intend to continue developing on the lighting network and hopefully deploy a fully functioning Lapp in the coming weeks. 

if you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments please feel free to create an issue or PR.
